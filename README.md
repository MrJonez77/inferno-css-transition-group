# Inferno CSS Transition Group

An Inferno-aliased version of [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable), originally extracted from the React codebase, refactored to ES2015 and converted to use Inferno.

See [React's Animation Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) for usage.
